# Data-science-work
The Repository containing my work of data science projects completed by me for academic, learning, and contributing towards data science community. Presented in the form of Colab Notebooks and sometime I also upload pycharm file.

## Machine Learning-
### Acea Smart Water Analytics Competition
I tried to develop several Machine Learning Model to predict the water availability over a period of month in water resources like (Lake, River, Aquifers, and Water-Spring) based no based on previous 22 years data.
The more about competition can be find here- https://www.kaggle.com/c/acea-water-prediction
#### Overview of project-
This competition has total 9 different csv file, and all of them contain time series data from 1998 to 2006, Theses data set have lots of missing value so Firstly I cleaned the missing data then I performed some EDA and feature engineering technique (This competition is more and more about data analysis task so I did most of my work in data visualization and Exploratory data analysis) then I developed a Machine Learning Model to predict the output.

### Loan prediction- 
A model to predict the weather loan of person should get approved or not based on their financial, professional, and personal background using various statistical analysis tools. The data set I got at analytics. Vidhya.
#### Overview of project-
Firstly, I cleaned the data, then I used some Exploratory data analysis technique to get the better understating of data, then I crated some new feature which might be useful for model building, then I used several algorithms to predict the output, The algorithms are Random Forest, KNN, and Xgboost.

### spam filtering and sentiment analysis using NLP
In this project I have done data cleaning, then visulaization of most frequence word using Word Cloud then I developed a model to classify whether 
email is spam or not using GradientBoostingClassifier() (97% accuracy), then further did sentiment analysis of emails.

### Making Nural netowrk model from scratch

In this project, I created a nural network model for binery classification, and I have also visualise the result that how increasing the hidden layer( fitting too complex model can lead to overfitting), and I have also tried some way to overcome from overfitting.

###  Building mobile price rance classifier Deep Nural network model using Keras

In this project, I Developed a simple nural network model of two hidden layer, and I used  "relu" activation function for hidden layer and "softmax" activation function for output layer.
